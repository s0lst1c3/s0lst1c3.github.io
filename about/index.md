I currently work as a security consultant at Gotham Digital Science, where I split my time between client engagements and research. I'm also the wireless security lead for the BSides Las Vegas NOC team. Previously I've worked for OGSystems and Rutgers University. Things that make me excited include wireless security, smashing binaries, and playing with fire. In my spare time I enjoy live music, literature, and riding motorcycles.
