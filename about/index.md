I'm an undergraduate student at Rutgers University working towards a B.S. in Computer Science. I'm also currently employed as part of a co-op with the Viper OFFS3C team at [OGSystems](http://ogsystems.com). We build security tools, conduct pentests, and do all kinds of other cool stuff. Previously I have worked as an independent contractor for [Top Hat Security](http://top-hat-sec.com), and as a student systems programmer for [Rutgers OIT](http://oit.rutgers.edu). On my spare time I enjoy reading novels, cooking, kayaking, riding and working on motorcycles, as well as writing and listening to music. I'm also a volunteer firefighter.
