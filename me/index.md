Security R&D and red teamer. Former Digital Silence, GDS Security. Author of:

- [EAPHammer](https://github.com/s0lst1c3/eaphammer) - EAPHammer is a toolkit for performing targeted evil twin attacks against WPA2-Enterprise networks. It is designed to be used in full scope wireless assessments and red team engagements.
- [SilentBridge](https://github.com/s0lst1c3/silentbridge) - SilentBridge is a toolkit for quickly bypassing 802.1x port security first presented at DEF CON 26. It provides the first documented means of bypassing 802.1x-2010 via its authentication process, as well as improvements to existing techniques for bypassing 802.1x-2004.

I've presented at DEF CON, DerbyCon, Hackfest, 44con, SecTor, and several Security BSides conferences on topics ranging from wireless and infrastructure security to access control protocols and red team tradecraft. I have also taught workshops on advanced wireless tactics for clients and at international industry conferences. My other technical interests include systems internals, low-level programming, payload development, and infrastructure automation.
